           Replaced everywhere type
		Interfaces.C.Unsigned_Long
	   with type 
		Interfaces.Unsigned_32
	   Unsigned_Long is 64 bits long in 64 bits archs,
	   and inet_addr must be 32 bits long even in 64 bits archs.

2011.10.25 jcenteno
	   Changed Lower_Layer."="(Left, Right: Address_CA) to avoid raising i
           Null_Address if an operand is Null.  Now returns True if both
           operands are Null and False if only one operand is Null.

2008.11.11 jcenteno&pheras [BUG, MAYOR]
	   Fixed warning in concurrency.adb Mutex.Enter entry: first appearing
	   with gnat-4.3, causing Program_Error with all Lower_Layer programs
	   Changed Mutex.Enter calls in lower_layer-inet.adb, 
	   lower_layer-inet-tcp.adb and lower_layer-inet-udp.adb.

2008.11.11 jcenteno [MINOR]
	   added VERSION file, set version at 3.0

2007.11.26 jcenteno [MAYOR]
	   in lower_layer-inet.adb and lower_layer_udp.adb 
	   changed max buffer size from 5000 to 65535 - 28, to handle the 
	   biggest possible udp datagram

2007.11.26 jcenteno [MINOR]
	   in lower_layer-inet.adb, changed Bind and Check_Dummy 
	   Put_Exception_Error's turning them into debugging conditioned

	   impossible to catch/remove by user programs

2007.11.26 jcenteno [MINOR]
	   Fixed several Sending_Error exceptions when running in
	   Ubuntu64, related to apoloval bugs fixed on 2006.03.27,

2006.10.17 jcenteno [MINOR]
	   Fixed several PROGRAM_ERROR exceptions when compiled
	   with gnat-4.0 at Ubuntu Dapper (due to gnat bugs, probably)
	     in lower_layer-inet.adb:546, changed from Data'Access
		to Data'Unrestricted_Access
	     in lower_layer_udp.adb:598 and 809, changed from Data
		to Data.all'Access
	   This changes are unnecessary with gnat-4.1 at Debian
		
2006.10.16 jcenteno [MINOR]

	   values to achieve real randomization

2006.03.27 apoloval [BUG]
	   Serveral fixes to ada_sockets.adb, c_sockets.ads, c_sockets-arch.ads
	   to fix compilation/runtime errors in gnat-4.0 and/or Darwin/Mac OS X

2006.03.27 jcenteno [BUG}
	   In lower_layer_udp.adb, now a set_fault_percent of 0 really
	   works as no faults at all	   

2006.03.27 pheras [MAYOR] 
	   In lower_layer_udp.adb, use a pool of
	   buffers to store incoming messages instead a single one,
	   discarding messages if all the buffers are full, instead of
	   blocking

2005.12.05 jcenteno [MINOR]
	   Improved random delays generation in lower_layer_udp.adb,
	   Delay_Buffer_Access.Add (needs further improvement)	

2005.12.05 jcenteno [MAYOR]
	   Now all Send subprograms DOES NOT RESET the Buffer

2005.12.05 jcenteno [MINOR]
